	<ui:define name="contentTitle">Form Command</ui:define>

	<ui:define name="content">

	<p>
	Form-Command is to define the form's layout include header, footer etc.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note: If there's no form-command defined, then the whole sheet will be treated as one form.
	</p>
	<h2>How to define?</h2>
	<p>Use the special syntax below defined in the comment for the staring cell of the form.</p>
	<div class="source">
	<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">tie:form(name="departments" length="10" headerLength="2" footerLength="1")</pre>
	</div>
	</div>
	<p>Note:<br/> 
	1. If set headerLength to 0, then web sheet will still use excel letters as column header. <br/>
	2. Explain the form's area: the form's top and left are the cell's position. Right column position is automatic calculated based on the content. Bottom is top plus form length.<br/>
	3. Each command in the comment must remain in the same line, don't use enter key to divide it.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Command Attributes</h2>
	<ul>
	
		<li>name : form's name and will be displayed as a tab's title </li>
