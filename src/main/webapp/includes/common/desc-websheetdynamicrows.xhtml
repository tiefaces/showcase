	<h3>Use Case 4: Dynamic Rows</h3>
	<p>
	In some cases, we actually don't know how many rows we really need while the relationship between each column keep the same, e.g. Column C = Column A + Column B. In the Excel, typically we would create maximize rows we may need, e.g. we have to define 100 rows even though most of users only use 10 rows.
	</p>
	<p>Web Sheet dynamic rows feature could easily resolve this issue: only one row is defined in the template while allow add/delete rows in the runtime. See the demo for details.    
	</p>
	<p>
	(Note: dynamic rows also used in web reports. In the web reports demo, we also only defined one row for data section.)
