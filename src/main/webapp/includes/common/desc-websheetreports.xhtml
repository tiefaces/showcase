	<h3>Use Case 2: Web Reports</h3>
	<p>
	One headache in application development is clients may require to change their reports from time to time. Normally this will invlove code changes even the middle tire remain the same.    
	</p>
	<p>
	Web Sheet seperate the presentation tier's modification from the application changes. Bascically you can design/change any format of reports in Excel then save it to your repository (e.g. databases). Web Sheet will pick up your changes from there without application code changes.
