	<h3>What is TieFaces WebSheet</h3>
	<p>
	WebSheet component bring your Excel Spread Sheets to web as web forms. You can easily open a Excel Sheet online and edit/populate data to it.   
	
	Web sheet is not intend to become online document tools like Google Docs, instead it want to become a gateway or transformer of Excel sheets to Web forms. Basically the Excel sheets are treated as templates, with some restrictions (e.g. only unlocked cell become editable), it's transformed to web sheet with same look and feels and behaviors in Excel. With some configuration, we can even go further, e.g. populate from database, generate reports based on data etc.
