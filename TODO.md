- Fix bug for load heading. Try change the way to loadbody as Primefaces support col/row span now.
- Add version to Configuration Tab. This will enable future change on configuration structures.
- Support no configuration tab sheet. E.g. load pure Excel Spreadsheet. If found no configuration, then assume user want to load the entire workbooks as web sheets.
- Support Font type/color in body cells. Need look at how POI and Excel deal with Fonts and Colors
- Support add/delete row in Repeat style form
- Add unit test for web sheet
